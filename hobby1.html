            <h1>Coding</h1>
            <p>These are some of the things I've worked on for fun in my free time.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h2>picasso</h2>
                    <p style="width: 50%;">
                        (Picture In Computed ASCII Style with Scripted Operations)
                        This is a program I wrote using Rust to take a reference image and generate corresponding ASCII art.

                    <h2>Arch Linux</h2>
                    <p style="width: 50%;">
                        I took the base distribution of Arch Linux and built my own desktop on it using the Hyprland compositor. 
                        It is a fully featured desktop, and because I've added everything myself including only what I think I want, 
                        there's very little background processing. At any given moment if I'm not actively using the computer, 
                        background processes use about half of a percent of my CPU's power.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Neural Network</h2>
                    <p style="width: 50%;">
                        In high school I did a project to predict changes in the stock market using TensorFlow with python. 
                        At an internship after freshman year, I created a similar program to predict which counties were most likely 
                        to invest in the companie's product. Given how useful neural networks have been in my life already, I decided to
                        write a neural network library in Rust. It's basic and has no advantage over any existing library, but now 
                        I know how to do it.
